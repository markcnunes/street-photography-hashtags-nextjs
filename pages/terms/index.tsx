        You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the website, any part of the
        website, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
        extract the source code of the website, and you also shouldn’t try to

        Mark Nunes is committed to ensuring that the website is as useful and
        efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make
        changes to the website or to charge for its services, at any time and
        for any reason. We will never charge you for the website or its services
        without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

      <p>
        The Street Photography Hashtags website stores and processes personal
        data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my Service. It’s
        your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the website secure.
        We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone,
        which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations
        imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make
        your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise
        your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Potluck
        Keywords website won’t work properly or at all.

      <p>
        The website does use third party services that declare their own Terms
        and Conditions.

        You should be aware that there are certain things that Mark Nunes will
        not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the website will
        require the website to have an active internet connection. The
        connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider,
        but Mark Nunes cannot take responsibility for the website not working at
        full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have
        any of your data allowance left.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you’re using the website outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
        remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network
        provider will still websitely. As a result, you may be charged by your
        mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection
        while accessing the website, or other third party charges. In using the
        website, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including
        roaming data charges if you use the website outside of your home
        territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
        you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the
        website, please be aware that we assume that you have received
        permission from the bill payer for using the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the same lines, Mark Nunes cannot always take responsibility for
        the way you use the website i.e. You need to make sure that your device
        stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to
        avail the Service, Mark Nunes cannot accept responsibility.

        when you’re using the website, it’s important to bear in mind that

        we can make it available to you. Mark Nunes accepts no liability for any
        loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly
