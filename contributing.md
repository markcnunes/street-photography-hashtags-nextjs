# The street photography hashtags manifesto

If you want your keyword to be included on `street photography hashtags`, try to only include actual awesome keywords. After all, it's a curation, not a collection.

## Guidelines for adding new keywords

Research if the stuff you're including has actually good visibility. Only suggest keywords that you or another contributor can personally recommend. You should rather leave stuff out than include too much. Only # keywords are accepted, @ keywords won't be added to this project to keep the lists simple.

<br>

### Only add hashtags

Only hashtags are accepted. Mentions for keywords won't be allowed
because these accounts most of the time have hashtags as well. It will help us to filter duplications and prevent too many
self-promotions.

<br>

### Assign to the right category

Apart from suggesting a particular hashtag, you should also ensure it is added to the category that best fits it.

<br>

### Only add awesome keywords

Ensure the keyword has good visibility. Wait at least 30 days if it is a newborn keyword before submitting it, to give it a chance to mature.

<br>

### Pay attention to the typo

Ensure your keyword is typo correctly as a misspelling can direct to the wrong hashtag. This should also apply to pull requests.

It usually will take me within 24-48 hours to respond to any issue or request. Here are some basic rules to follow to ensure the timely addition of your request:

1. If its a feature, bugfix, or anything please only change code to what you specify.
2. Please keep PR titles easy to read and descriptive of changes, this will make them easier to merge :)
3. Pull requests _must_ be made against `development` branch. Any other branch (unless specified by the maintainers) will get rejected.
4. Check for existing [issues](https://github.com/markcnunes/street-photography-hashtags/issues) first, before filing an issue.
